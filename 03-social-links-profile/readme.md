## :question: Why

Yet another super simple project, I know. I’m trying to build the habit of coding every day, so when I don’t feel like it I use these types of projects to stay sharp without relying on any CSS preprocessors or frameworks.

## :computer: What did I learn/practice

This profile card was the perfect opportunity to remind me that you don't always need flexbox and tons of code, sometimes good old margins and padding get the job done. I also put an old-school centering trick into practice using absolute positioning.
