## :question: Why

This project, although it looks simple at first glance, took me a fair amount of time and effort. I wanted to build something small but complete, a challenge that forced me to think through UI details, validation flow, edge cases, and overall UX.

## :computer: What did I learn/practice

The main goal with this challenge was to practice some client-side form validation without relaying on any libraries. I also got to refine the styling, especially around adding visual cues for invalid or incomplete fields. Overall, it was a great exercise in tying together JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and interface feedback.
